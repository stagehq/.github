# Stage, API-based developer portfolio
Stage is an API-based developer portfolio platform that helps developers showcase their projects, skills, and experience to potential employers. With an ever-growing collection of building blocks, developers can personalize their portfolios to stand out from the crowd.

## Motivation
Developers need to showcase their work and skills in a way that's easy to understand and visually appealing to potential employers. However, building a portfolio website from scratch can be time-consuming and detract from the actual work that developers want to showcase. GetStage aims to simplify this process by providing an API-based platform that connects to various sources of content and social media to create a beautiful and always up-to-date site.

## Features
### Connect your content ‚úçÔ∏è:
